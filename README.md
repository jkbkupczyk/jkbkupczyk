# Hi, I'm Jacob 👋

Java Software Engineer with a focus on backend development.
In my daily work at [PagoNxt](https://github.com/pagonxt), I build and maintain microservice-based systems using 
_Java_ and _Spring Boot_.
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at [WSB Merito University](https://www.merito.pl/english/) and 
expanding my knowledge in Go and game development with LWJGL as well as writing shaders using GLSL.

Outside of software engineering, I train calisthenics and do amateur astronomy with my 6" Dobsonian telescope 🔭

## Focus
- _Java_ (21 - 25), Spring Boot
- Distribution systems and microservices
- _Go_ (learning)
- _LWJGL_ && _OpenGL_ && _GLSL_
